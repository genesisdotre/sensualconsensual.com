		<h1>sensual consensual</h1>

		<h3>reputation is something you build for years</h3>
		<h3>not sure if I want to do this under my current legal name</h3>
		<h3>not sure if I want to do this at all</h3>
		<h3>in the spirit of radical transparency...</h3>
		<h3>trusting the universe, collective consciousness, crowdsourced wisdom, higher intelligence</h3>

		<h2><s>not promoting <strong>male escort business</strong> for now</s></h2>
		<h2>actually giving this idea yet another shot - everyone is laughing when I tell them the name - I could get some free clicks if some media outlet picks this up</h2>

<pre>I’m fairly intelligent.
I’m fairly good looking.
I have reputation of being unconventional, funny, different.

But it’s not about me, it’s about you. 

You deserve to have the time of your life. 

Target - businesswoman who does not have time for boyfriends relationships drama.

I am full of insights and realisations - I’m here to empower you.

Behind every visionary woman there is a visionary man.

Back in a day I was working in an institution, selling my time for money, I called myself “mental prostitute”

Climbing 13 floors each day to avoid 9am elevator rush hour and stopping on each and every floor.

This time around I’ll also sell time and if you want to use my skills to work on the code - that’s OK too, everything in a consensual way.
- Event support (hustling at trade shows and conferences)
- Web development
- Cryptocurrency education

I issue invoices. So if you have a business and you spend money that belongs to the company - I’ve got you covered.

Pricing: fair, just, reasonable.

I do this for fun too, hack the system! See the wiki entry: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution_in_Poland#Current_status

"Prostitution is the only profession in Poland that is not taxed, but sex workers may be asked by authorities to prove that is what they do, since prostitution is not recognized as legitimate work, and therefore receive no social benefits."

(we can skillfully navigate the regulation, compliance, red tape and make everyone happy)

The best jokes are on the edge of being believable.

I would be grateful if some media outlet could pick up this story. And send some traffic to more reputable enterprises of mine.

I was an asshole to my ex-wife, generated a lot of karma - now I'm on a mission to meaningfully impact every being on this planet and beyond - highest vibration, love and light.

Subject like sex, drugs, money are no longer taboo for me - it’s the smalltalk that I treat as waste of time.

I really wish I knew then how to talk about sexuality, intimacy, relationships, boundaries, consent... Total paradigm shift yes please, here some data backing it: https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/darwin-eternity/201108/are-people-naturally-polygamous-0

"Overall, of the 1,231 cultures in the Ethnographic Atlas Codebook, 84.6 percent are classified as polygynous, 15.1 percent as monogamous, and 0.3 percent as polyandrous."

Cultural conditioning WTF, note that I've never been poly, we never even had a single conversation - I've just stopped talking, stopped engaging, withdrawn myself, kept emotions inside... Such a recipe for disaster! Body gave me signals - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alopecia_areata - mind over matter, I started losing hair because of suppressed emotions.

Now I'm in the process of healing - physical symptoms are gone, hair has grown back - still collecting pieces of my broken heart. I admit that I've set priorities poorly - "to be able to say what I really think" was not the "highest vibration" (should have aimed higher) - family law secret courts total bullshit legal fiction - THOUGHT POLICE is in place.

(still cannot say what I really think)</pre>
